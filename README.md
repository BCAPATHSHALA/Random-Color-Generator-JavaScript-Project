## Features

- Generate Random Colors: Click the `Start` button to initiate the generation of random colors in both `HEX` and `RGB` formats.
- Stop Generation: Press the `Stop` button to halt the generation of random colors.
- Copy Color Code: Easily copy the generated color code by clicking the `Copy` button.
- Color Display: A visual representation of the generated color is displayed on the page.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/random-color-generator-javascript-project.git

   ```

- Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
- Interact with the buttons to `generate`, `stop`, and `copy` random colors.

## How it Works

The random color generator leverages the `setInterval` method to generate the color every millisecond. The `clearInterval` method is used to pause the random color to generate. The generated color is displayed on the interface by manipulating the DOM.
